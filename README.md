# Tic Tac Toe (Python)

A simple **Tic Tac Toe** game implemented in Python. The game allows a human player to compete against a computer opponent.

## Features
- **Human vs Computer** gameplay.
- **Random Move Selection** for the computer.
- **Auto-detection of Wins, Losses, and Draws**.
- **Command-line based interface**.

## How to Play
- The game starts with the computer placing an `X` in the center of the board.
- The player is prompted to enter a move by selecting a number (1-9).
- The game board updates after each move.
- The first player to align three symbols (`X` or `O`) **horizontally, vertically, or diagonally** wins.
- If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.

## Game Board Layout
Each number represents a possible move location:
```
+-------+-------+-------+
|   1   |   2   |   3   |
+-------+-------+-------+
|   4   |   5   |   6   |
+-------+-------+-------+
|   7   |   8   |   9   |
+-------+-------+-------+
```
- Enter a number to place your **O** in that spot.

## Installation & Running

## Future Improvements
- Improve AI with **Minimax Algorithm** for strategic moves.
- Add **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using Tkinter or Pygame.
- Implement a **two-player mode**.
